# Who Died When?

WDW is a simple website that helps you find out if a character has died on a TV show or not.

Sometimes, when I'm watching older shows and I see a character in mortal danger, I want to know their fate. Popular shows have wikis, but a lot don't. So I build WDW.

You can browse and search for your favorite shows and characters, and mark them as dead. You can add missing shows, characters, and deaths.

## Dev

WDW is built with [Remix](https://remix.run), a new framework for building websites. It's essentially a playground for me to try this new tech out.

### Ingredients
